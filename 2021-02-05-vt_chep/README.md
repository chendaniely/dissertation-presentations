Creation of learner personas for a biomedical data science curriculum

## Brief Description for Conference Program (100 word max):
100 words:
In order to determine a learner’s knowledge base and what knowledge gaps exist in their mental model in the area of biomedical data science, a self-assessment survey was used to establish learner personas. Self-assessment results showed programming and data management gaps, and these personas encapsulate background, prior knowledge or experience, perception of needs, and special considerations. The survey asked about domain and programming experience, data management, and statistics knowledge. Results clustered to create four learner personas. These personas framed the creation of biomed-focused, open-access material that is offered in virtual workshops and self-paced online materials. 

## Proposal (500 word max):
480 words:
As data science becomes a more essential skillset and integrated across a variety of fields, including but not limited to biology, humanities, law, and medicine, a more focused curriculum per discipline is needed to engage more learners. In order to improve learner engagement, it is necessary to have teaching and learning materials that resonate, are relevant, and are at the appropriate level for learners in order to motivate and support their learning in a difficult skill (e.g. programming). A learner's prior knowledge and the way learners have them organized in their mental model will influence the way they learn. Learner personas are fictional characters that represent key characteristics of a particular learner and establish this base knowledge in domain, technical, and statistical concepts. In order to establish a learner knowledge baseline and knowledge gaps in a population of learners, we created a self-assessment survey that was used to create learner personas in biomedical data science. This work seeks to fill a technical skill gap, along with workforce development, and promote multidisciplinary collaborative teams by teaching the skills and jargon used in data science. This work also seeks to provide future educators with a roadmap of creating learner personas when creating new bodies of teaching materials relevant to data literacy.
The self-assessment survey established our learner’s backgrounds in domain and programming experience, data management, and statistics knowledge, and highlighted gaps and areas of data science content creation that is currently lacking in the biomedical domain. Hierarchical clustering was performed on survey results and identified four unique personas (n = 45):  (1) Experts, (2) Clinicians, (3) Academics, (4) Students. There were 2 main splits in response data, with the Experts split from the rest of the personas. This is a common challenge when teaching a technical class where there is usually a bimodal skill difference among the learners. The Clinicians were the group that had the least amount of programming and data experience. The main difference between the Academics and Student personas were the familiarity with newer data science tools. All personas had familiarity with Excel, and this was used as the basis for the first module for the workshop and learning materials. These personas and survey results were used to create a content series (self-paced or interactive in-person or online workshops) on biomedical data science unique to the needs of each learner persona but cohesive enough to meet overarching learning objectives, benefit a larger population in the biomedical sciences, and create both interactive and self-guided content and resources.
The interactive and self-guided materials along with the surveys and analysis can be found at: https://ds4biomed.tech/. We hope these materials will serve as the basis for future educators when they are planning to create new learning materials and the data-driven need of creating learner personas which can be used to identify and cater to learner’s needs for a more effective and relevant data science curriculum based on their discipline.
