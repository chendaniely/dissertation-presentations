# Background

---

# Data Science Education in the Biomedical Sciences

- "Integrating scientific programming in communities of practice for students in life science"
    - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3332186.3333040
- People in the life sciences are afraid to take courses in CS and Stats

## Goal

- Create an inviting learning environment
- Start from scratch
  - Positive comment from a learner in post-workshop survey

???

ds education in general has room for growth
---

# Dreyfus model of skill acquisition

- Novice
- Competent
- Expert

## This isn't new...

- Creating learner personas to focus materials and learning objectives
- Motivating examples with formative assessments
- Surveying learners
- Curriculum is full
  - Figuring out what to take out
      - Plotting and logistic regression

---

# Already existing learning materials


## But...
- General purpose, not domain focused
  - Plays a big role in motivation and building mental models

---

# Build a community

## At VT

- Help augment the training from Center for Biostatistics and Health Data Science (CBHDS)
    - https://biostat.centers.vt.edu/
- Goal is not to teach statistics but the data literacy side of data science
    - Managing and "cleaning" data
    - Be able to better communicate with analysts and statisticians
- Symbiotic relationship
  - Data Services and Data Bridge at the Library
  - The VT Carpentries community
  - CBHDS

## In general

- R/Medicine community
- Biomedical informatics

---

# Sustanining a commmunity of practice

- Open educational materials
- Resources and people to help
- Influx and efflux of people

## In-person and online

# Overall Dissertation Overview

---

# Phases + research questions

### IRB

- **IRB 20-537**: Data Science Workshops for Biomedical and Health Professionals: Persona Identification and Workshop Assessment

### 3 Phases (i.e., 3 papers + chapters)

Survey based (Adapted from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/assessment/)):

1. Pre-workshop student **self-assessment** survey
  - create learner personas
2. **Pre/post workshop** survey
  - assess the workshop materials
  - assess learning objectives
3. **Long-term workshop** survey (6 months out)
  - see if the materials helped with fundamental knowledge to learn more on their own
  - longitudinal study

---

# (Community) Deliverables

In addition to the 3 papers + chapters:

1. Identify and create learner personas for the biomedical community
2. Create a set of CC-0 lessons for the biomedical community
  - Carpentries-inspired
  - Carpenties Incubator: Data Science for Practicing Clinicians
      - https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/Data-Science-for-Docs/
      - Too much emphasis on Medical Doctors
---

# Current progress

1. IRB approved study: IRB 20-537 (Summer 2020)
2. Conducted the pre-workshop learner self-assessment (Summer 2020)
3. Created 4 learner personas (Fall 2020)
4. Created workshop content and learning materials (Fall 2020)
5. Conducted first iteration of workshops (October 20 and 22, 2020)
6. 2 x 1-day 4-hour workshops scheduled in December (8 + 9, 2020)

## Planning for
7. More workshops in 2021
  - On the order of once per month
  - Current + new materials
8. Prelims in Feburary 2021

# Learning Objectives

Using Bloom's taxonomy:

1. Name the features of a tidy/clean dataset
2. Transform data for analysis
3. Identify when spreadsheets are useful
4. Assess when a task should not be done in a spreadsheet software
5. Break down data processing into smaller individual (and more manageable) steps
6. Construct a plot and table for exploratory data analysis
7. Build a data processing pipeline that can be used in multiple programs
8. Calculate, interpret, and communicate an appropriate statistical analysis of the data

# EFA Results

- 3 factors with promax rotation.
  - Each factor coincided with a survey question blocks

- Programming:
  - Q3.3: How familiar are you with interactive programming languages like Python or R?
- Stats:
  - Q6.2: If you were given a dateset containing an individual's smoking status (binary variable) and whether or not they have hypertension (binary variable), would you know how to conduct a statistical analysis to see if smoking has an increased relative risk or odds of hypertension? Any type of model will suffice.
- Data:
  - Q4.4: Do you know what "long" and "wide" data are?
